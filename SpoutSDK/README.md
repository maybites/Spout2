- [SpoutGL](https://spoutgl-site.netlify.app/)

Contains the Spout SDK source files and a Visual Studio project to build the SDK as a dll.\
The project can also be generated by CMake. See "Building the libraries.pdf" in the root folder.\
Pre-built binaries can be found in the BUILD/Binaries folder.\
Well commented Sender and Receiver OpenGL examples built with OpenFrameworks are the first place to look.

- [SpoutLibrary](https://spoutlibrary-site.netlify.app/)

The Spout SDK as a C-compatible dll that can be used with compilers other than Visual Studio.

- [SpoutDirectX](https://spoutdx-site.netlify.app/)

A sub-set of the Spout SDK for applications using DirectX rather than OpenGL.\
SpoutDX is a support class for that provides functions similar to those in the OpenGL version of the SDK.\
Several examples show details of use.\
SpoutDX was originally designed for D3D11 and has been extended for D3D12 and D3D9. These contain very similar methods, but have not been tested in practical applications and should be considered as developmental.
